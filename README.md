# Distributed System Management using Hashing Techniques [Data Structures BS Project]

Welcome to the "Distributed System Management using Hashing Techniques" GitHub repository! This project showcases the development of a distributed system management solution using various data structures such as Linked Lists, Hashing, AVL Trees, and Heap. This project was undertaken as part of our DATA Structures course's final project.

## Description

Managing distributed systems efficiently is crucial in today's complex computing environments. This repository presents a comprehensive solution that leverages multiple data structures to achieve efficient distributed system management. The employed data structures include:

- **Linked Lists:** Used for organizing and managing various elements of the distributed system.
- **Hashing:** Employed to enable quick access to distributed system components based on their unique identifiers.
- **AVL Trees:** Used for maintaining balanced structures and efficient search operations.
- **Heap:** Utilized for optimizing resource allocation and management in the distributed system.

This project serves as both a practical application of data structures and a demonstration of their significance in distributed system management.
